      <div id="notify"> A large part of this study involved recording videos of the person we interviewed, and 
    analysing his thought process when using different search tools for design inspiration.
    The video and presentation can be made available on request!</div>

    <br><br>

      This is a report of an ethnographic case study which was aimed at observing how designers
      working in large teams use google search to gain design inspiration and make design decisions
      while working in teams. 

      <br><br>
      Me and a group of 2 other people interviewed a designer at Digital Telepathy. We interviewed
      the designer John (name withheld) about his daily design process.

      <br><br>
      Firstly, we made some key observations on how the workspace would affect
      the design process of the people involed. The office layout facilitated close
      interaction amongst designers and developers. There was no distinction in the role of the 
      people in areas. The lunch area doubled as a meeting area for large team meetings 
      and announcements. The following is a rough layout of the office.

      <br>

      <img id="im" width="400" height="300" src="http://puu.sh/pBOU0/c3143f6de6.png"></img>

      <br><br>
      We also gathered some information and drafted a rough persona of the person we were interviewing.
      <ul>
        <li>Senior UI/UX Designer</li>
        <li>>5 years experience</li>
        <li>Very organized person. Uses a Macbook Pro 15" and an external monitor for design work. We
        found a bunch of notebooks lying around and some diaries. We assumed, that he puts them to 
        use for drafting ideas and planning his work.</li>
      </ul>

      <br>
      Being a senior designer, John mentioned that "most of his work is already done", because he 
      has already been in the field for a very long time and knows what has worked for him in the past.
      In terms of Google search, he said that he hated results that head already seen previously.

      <br><br>
      <strong><span id="quote" style="text-align:center;">"I’m looking for the best product design practices, patterns, and something innovative and new."</span></strong>

      <br><br>
      <span class="question" id="orange">How does John search for design information?</span><br><br>
      John mentioned that he relies on a more collaborative style of working and thus references 
      his co-workers' projects and ideas most of the time. At other times, he looks at the work
      of competitors and performs competitive analysis in the design process.

      Some other tools he mentioned that he used for "passive search" include:
      <ul>
        <li>Product Design Weekly - He particularly liked this because it was a curated list of best product
          design tips and practices. He came to know about it from a co-worker. Since a lot of his co-workers are
          also subscribed to the same list, there was room for discussion on several common topics. </li>
        <li>Dribble - To look for visual/aesthetic inspiration. He mainly uses it to stay up to date with the latest 
          design trends but doesn’t really think it’s substantial.</li>
        <li>Instagram - Mainly to look at aesthetic work but claims the lack of depth for it qualify as good design</li>
      </ul>

      <br>
      <span class="need">There is a need for John to quickly reference a co-worker and/or competitor's
      work (that has been succesful in the past).</span>

      <br><br>
      We observed after a brief talk with him, that he didn't really use Google search actively. On being asked
      to describe the search results he obtained through Dribbble:
  
      <br><br>
      <span class="question" id="orange">What does John look for in a robust searching tool?</span><br>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Search with Multiple Tags</li>
        <li>Deep Dive browsing</li>
        <li>Filtering Searches</li>
      </ul>

      <br>

      <span class="need">Needs a way to search for case studies and workflows for design processes in the 
        context of his work.</span>

      <br><br>
      He usually searches for inspiration for individual elements of a website or composite design.
      and when looking through search results, spends a maximum of 1 second evaluating each design. The 
      vast array of search results makes it harder for him to come to a decision.

      <br><br>
      <span class="need">Needs to receive short curated list of current design practices that he hasn’t already seen.</span>

      <br><br>
      The above need adheres to the attributes of John's search habits - they are short, not repetitive and are of good
      quality since they have been curated.

      The following is solution we proposed taking John's input on the ideal design search tool".

      <br><br>
      <strong><span  id="quote" style="text-align:center;">"The ideal search tool would almost be like an intern."</span></strong>

      <ul>
        <li>No interface</li>
        <li>Always online</li>
        <li>Connected with mail, calendar and all communication channels</li>
        <li>Able to understand John's search preferences, learn from his choices made online and return 
            appropriate results, almost automating the design search process.</li>
      </ul>
