      <h1>Ethnographic Case Study</h1>

    <section id = "article">
      This is a report of a ethnographic case study which was aimed at observing how designers
      working in large teams use google search to gain design inspiration and make design decisions
      while working in teams. 

      <br><br>
      Me and a group of 2 other people interviewed a designer at Digital Telepathy. We interviewed
      the designer John (name withheld) about his design process as he went about his daily design process.

      <br><br>
      We first observed the workspace and tried to note key observations on how this would affect
      the design process of the people involed. The following is a rough layout of the office.

      <br><br>
      We also gathered some information and drafted a rough persona of the person we were interviewing.
      <ul>
        <li>Senior UI/UX Designer</li>
        <li>>5 years experience</li>
        <li>Very organized person. Uses a Macbook Pro 15" and an external monitor for design work. We
        found a bunch of notebooks lying around and some diaries. We assumed, that he puts them to 
        use for drafting ideas and planning his work.</li>
      </ul>

      <br>
      Being a senior designer, John mentioned that "most of his work is already done", because he 
      has already been in the field for a very long time and knows what has worked for him in the past.
      In terms of Google search, he said that he hated results that head already seen previously.

      <br><br>
      <strong><span style="text-align:center;">"I’m looking for the best product design practices, patterns, and something innovative and new."</span></strong>

      <br><br>
      <span id="orange">How does John search for design information?</span><br><br>
      John mentioned that he relies on a more collaborative style of working and thus references 
      his co-workers' projects and ideas most of the time. At other times, he looks at the work
      of competitors and performs competitive analysis in the design process.

      Some other tools he mentioned that he used for "passive search" include:
      <ul>
        <li>Product Design Weekly - He particularly liked this because it was a curated list of best product
          design tips and practices. He came to know about it from a co-worker. Since a lot of his co-workers are
          also subscribed to the same list, there was room for discussion on several common topics. </li>
        <li>Dribble - To look for visual/aesthetic inspiration. He mainly uses it to stay up to date with the latest 
          design trends but doesn’t really think it’s substantial.</li>
        <li>Instagram - Mainly to look at aesthetic work but claims the lack of depth for it qualify as good design</li>
      </ul>

      <br>
      Latent Need - We observed that there was a need for John to quickly reference a co-worker and/or competitor's
      work (that has been succesful in the past).

      <br><br>
      We observed after a brief talk with him, that he didn't really use Google search actively.
